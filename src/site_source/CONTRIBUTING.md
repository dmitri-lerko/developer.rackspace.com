The Rackspace Developer Blog recently moved to a new repo, powered by our open-source content platform, [deconst](https://github.com/deconst). The new repository for the blog's content is **[rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog)**. Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) of that repo for information about contributing to our new repository.
