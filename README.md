**We are no longer maintaing this repository.**

[developer.rackspace.com](https://developer.rackspace.com) is now powered by our open-source content platform, [deconst](https://github.com/deconst). As a result, the content for the site is now distributed among several different repositories:

* **[rackerlabs/nexus-control](https://github.com/rackerlabs/nexus-control)** contains the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML templates for the entire website. Aside from marketing-oriented copy, it does not contain any actual content.
* **[rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-developer-blog)** contains the Jekyll project that powers the developer blog.
* **[rackerlabs/docs-quickstart](https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-quickstart)** contains the ReST project that powers the “getting started” guides.

Please reference the guides for each of the respective repositories for more information.
